## Building

Requires an up-to-date version of the Flutter SDK. Dependencies will be downloaded automatically. As with all Flutter projects, use the `flutter build` commands to create a package for simulation or deployment. See [Flutter's documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/build-modes) for more details.
