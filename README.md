# DevilScout

Devil Scout is a unified scouting solution for FIRST Robotics Competition events, designed for teams who lack the resources to effectively collect and analyze data on their own. Rather than isolating each team's data, we pool everything from each event in order to produce more accurate analysis.

## Features

- Collect data from matches and pits
- Additional metadata powered by The Blue Alliance
- Team analysis summaries
- Management by team admins
- Synchronized across all devices
- And more to come in the future!

## Usage

See our [wiki](https://github.com/Team1559/DevilScout/wiki) for guides, instructions, and other assistance.
